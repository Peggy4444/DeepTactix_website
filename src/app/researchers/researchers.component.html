        <h2>Optimal Decision Making for Pass Direction and Action Selection</h2>
        <p>
          We use <strong>reinforcement learning</strong> to determine the optimal direction of passes and the best action selection (e.g., carry, pass, dribble, shot) during a match. Unlike traditional methods that merely evaluate historical actions, our approach enables teams to explore "what-if" scenarios and counterfactual analyses. This helps teams understand the potential outcomes of alternative decisions before deploying them on the field.

        <h2>Explainable AI for Shot and Pass Outcome Estimation</h2>
        <p>
          Our approach uses <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong> to handle the temporal and permutation-invariant nature of soccer data. The models predict the outcomes of shots and passes while considering contextual factors such as defensive compactness and player identities. This provides actionable insights into why certain actions succeed or fail, making the models both accurate and interpretable.

        <h2>In-Game Outcome Prediction</h2>
        <p>
          Our novel solution uses <strong>optimal action divergence</strong>—the difference between the value of the action a player took and the optimal action they could have taken to maximize expected goals (xG)—to predict game outcomes in real-time. This approach provides a strong data point for understanding how individual decisions impact the overall result of a match.

        <h2>The Challenges of Traditional Match Reports</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional match reports often rely on high-level summaries, such as goals, assists, and possession percentages. While these metrics provide a basic overview, they lack the depth needed to understand the nuances of a match. For example, they don’t capture defensive compactness, pressing effectiveness, or the context behind key events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Event data offers more granular insights, but it still falls short in providing a complete picture. It doesn’t account for spatial and temporal dynamics, such as player positioning, movement patterns, or the impact of team tactics. As a result, analysts struggle to extract actionable insights that can drive tactical adjustments.

        <h2>The Complexity of Tracking Data</h2>
        <p>
          Tracking data, which captures the spatial and temporal movements of players, provides a richer source of information. However, it comes with its own challenges. The data is inherently complex, requiring advanced methods to handle its spatial, temporal, and permutation-invariant nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without the right tools, it’s difficult to extract meaningful insights from tracking data. Analysts often struggle to contextualize the data, such as understanding how defensive compactness or pressing intensity impacts match outcomes. This limits their ability to provide actionable recommendations to coaches and players.

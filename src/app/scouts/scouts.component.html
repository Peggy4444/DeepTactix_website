        <h2>Are You Scouting the Right Player?</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s say you’re scouting for a new winger. You look at the aggregated xT (Expected Threat) values and see that Player A has a high xT. You might think, "Great, this player creates high-value actions!" But in reality, Player A might have been in the right place at the right time due to luck or team dynamics, not because of their individual skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          By ignoring player identity during training the ML models, you lose the ability to distinguish between skill and context. This can lead to <strong>overvaluing</strong> players who benefit from team tactics or luck, and <strong>undervaluing</strong> players who are truly skilled but play in less favorable conditions.

        <h2>The Challenge of Context in Player Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          This is where <strong>permutation invariant sorting schemes</strong> and <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong> come into play. These approaches ensure that the model understands the context of each action while respecting the fact that player identities matter. For example, a player’s ability to create high xT actions should be evaluated based on their individual skill, not just their position on the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re a scout or analyst, your goal is to identify players who can consistently create high-value actions based on their individual skills, not just their team’s dynamics. By addressing permutation invariance, you can accurately assess a player’s ability to create high xT actions, identify undervalued players in less dominant teams, and make smarter transfer decisions by understanding how a player’s skills fit into your team’s tactics.
